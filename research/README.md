# TradePilot research workspace

This Phase 1 workspace defines the initial market-data contract and validates a
small, explicitly synthetic EUR/USD H1 bid/ask fixture. It contains no trading
strategies, backtesting, live data integration, or execution logic.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or newer

## Setup

From `research/`, create and activate a virtual environment, then install the
package locally:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e .
```

No vendor credentials or third-party runtime packages are required.

## Validate the synthetic fixture

```powershell
tradepilot-validate fixtures/synthetic_eurusd_h1.csv
```

Alternatively, without installing the package:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
python -m tradepilot fixtures/synthetic_eurusd_h1.csv
```

The command writes a deterministic JSON quality report. It exits with status
`0` when there are no validation errors and status `1` when errors are found.
CSV parse or file errors exit with status `2`.

## Run tests

The tests use Python's standard-library test runner:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Data conventions

- Each timestamp is the candle-open time, ISO 8601, UTC-aware, and aligned to
  the start of an hour.
- Prices use decimal arithmetic; no binary floating-point conversion occurs.
- Each candle contains bid and ask OHLC values, with bid prices no greater than
  the corresponding ask prices.
- Gaps are reported as warnings rather than filled because weekends, holidays,
  or source outages require provenance-aware interpretation.
- The included fixture is synthetic and must not be represented as market data.
